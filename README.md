Dispenser
=========

An easier way to give out promo codes directly from your iPhone.

This was built to use codes from http://usetokens.com (no affiliation, I just like the product). You can use the Tokens Mac app, or any other means of getting promo codes, and paste them into this app to easily share. This app does not fetch codes from ITC etc. It is only meant as a UI for sharing.

I found that I was often handing out codes for my apps (http://proc.es) in person. Using a text file was getting tedious, so I built this in between sessions at Macworld.

Dispenser lets you set your own copy and share one or more codes via email, iMessage, etc.


Useful for devs, but also a simple app to showcase some iOS 6 goodies:

• UICollectionView

• Storyboards and segues (including unwind segues)

• UIActivityViewController (sharing) APIs




It's all about promotion.
